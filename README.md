<h3>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

Welcome to my GitHub page. 

I'm a part-time MA student in the [QMSS](https://qmss.columbia.edu/) program at Columbia University on the data science track. This semester, I'm taking <u>Advanced Analytics</u> with QMSS director [Gregory Eirich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-eirich-2541598/), an intellectually engaging and highly entertaining lecturer. This follows from his introductory course in probability and social statistics last semester, <u>Data Analysis for the Social Sciences</u>, where we learned to generate and interpret quantitative data using statistical software. I'm also taking my second Research Seminar course, where we hear from practicing data scientists (often QMSS graduates) about their projects, which have ranged from best practices for employee data to the effect of monetary policy on income inequality.

Leading up to QMSS, I taught myself [python programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program) with Jennifer Campbell and Paul Gries, and reviewed [calculus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-calculus) with David Easdown, both on Coursera; I highly recommend them both. I also relearned statistics in [Anthony Donaghue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-donoghue-66364237/)'s Statistical Thinking for Data Science, a deceptively simple course that demands you truly wrestle with the concepts to avoid mechanical application of formulae and procedures.

What draws me to data science? Quite simply, because data holds the answer to everything we want to know. In the past, answers could be found through careful observation of the physical world. <i>Dimmi</i>, Leonardo da Vinci wrote alongside his drawings of man and machine. <i>Tell me</i>. Today, those same words invoke answers not from the observable, but from bytes of data. <i>Dimmi</i>, we now all ask. What does the data say? 

I intend to find out.

I'll be sharing my various projects here on GitHub. Feel free to look around.
