<h3>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

Welcome to my GitHub page. 

I'm a part-time MA student in the [QMSS](https://qmss.columbia.edu/) program at Columbia University on the data science track. Having taken a leave of absence to start a new job, I am thrilled to be returning this summer to my studies. Iâ€™ll dive back in with AI & Social Science, taught by QMSS director [Gregory Eirich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-eirich-2541598/), and follow up with Natural Language Processing in the Social Sciences with [Patrick Houlihan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-houlihan-ph-d-mba-9310642/). I expect it will be 2 intense monthsâ€¦ and I can't wait!

I started the QMSS program with Data Analysis for the Social Sciences, where we learned to generate and interpret quantitative data using statistical software, and continued on to Advanced Analytics, where we gained more familiarity with more complex models. I also completed two Research Seminar courses, where we heard from practicing data scientists (often QMSS graduates) about current or past projects, ranging from best practices for employee data to the effect of monetary policy on income inequality.

Leading up to QMSS, I taught myself [python programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program) with Jennifer Campbell and Paul Gries, and reviewed [calculus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-calculus) with David Easdown, both on Coursera; I highly recommend them both. I also relearned statistics in [Anthony Donaghue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-donoghue-66364237/)'s Statistical Thinking for Data Science, a deceptively simple course that demands you truly wrestle with the concepts to avoid mechanical application of formulae and procedures.

What draws me to data science? Quite simply, because data holds the answer to everything we want to know. In the past, answers could be found through careful observation of the physical world. <i>Dimmi</i>, Leonardo da Vinci wrote alongside his drawings of man and machine. <i>Tell me</i>. Today, those same words invoke answers not from the observable, but from bytes of data. <i>Dimmi</i>, we now all ask. What does the data say? 

I intend to find out.

I'll be sharing my various projects here on GitHub. Feel free to look around.
